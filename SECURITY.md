## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any concerns about potential vulnerability and security issues, please, submit a report on https://github.com/cwy20030/RHelper/issues.
To ensure that we can effectively resolve the issue, all reports should contain...
1. a brief description of the risk or vulnerability
2. the operation system of the device (e.g., Windows) and the version
3. R version (which can be found when opening R)
4. RHelper Package Version (which is reported upon loading the library)
5. a reproducible script (which can be generated using <I>Historian()</I> )
6. a sample dataset (preferably in .txt format)
7. a screenshot of the output (including the warning or error message).

Reports submitted without sufficient descriptions of the issues and/or reproducible scripts will not be processed.
